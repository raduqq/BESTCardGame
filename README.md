# BESTCardGame
Team RaDaR

## Setup
To make this project work, download all and open it in Unity.

## Concept
Creating the new Hearthstone proved to be slightly overwhelming, so we pivoted last-minute towards building the fantasy version of Blackjack. The UI doesn't quite suggest it, as we didn't manage to implement the corresponding elements, but our hopes are that our presentation will explain this much more clearly.

## Logic
The UI elements and bare funcitonalities of the game can be observed in .cs files.
